Ask Your PDF is a simple Generative AI app built with LangChain, Streamlit, and OpenAI.  
It lets you upload a PDF and then ask natural language questions about its content.  
The app parses your PDF, creates embeddings for semantic search, and retrieves the most relevant sections to answer your questions.
